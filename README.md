A template for starting new projects. The manuscript folder contains LaTeX templates
from [SIAM](https://www.siam.org), and downloaded from their
[Macros](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/about-siam-journals/information-for-authors).

In the starter Manuscript folder, there is also a copy of exemplary macros, with an
article starter that I use for my projects. 

If it is the first time you work with a git repository, you may want to have a look
at the .gitignore file too, in the main folder.
